Step 2: Calculate the total number of 3-digit numbers. This is simply the product of the number of possibilities for each digit. So, there are 9 possibilities for the first digit, and 10 possibilities for each of the other two digits. Therefore, the total number of 3-digit numbers is 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.

If A beats B by 48 meters or 12 seconds, it means that B runs 48 meters in the time that A runs 12 seconds. So, the speed of B is 48 meters / 12 seconds = 4 m/s.
Since A and B start at the same time and A finishes the race when B is 48 meters behind, it means that the time it takes A to finish the race is the same time it takes B to run 1000 - 48 = 952 meters.

Step 2: From the problem, we know that A can complete the work in 4 hours. Therefore, the rate of A is 1/4 work per hour.
Step 3: Similarly, B and C together can complete the work in 3 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/3 work per hour.
Step 4: A and C together can complete the work in 2 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/2 work per hour.
Step 5: We can write the equation for the combined rates of A, B, and C as follows: a + b + c = 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 work per hour.
Step 6: We know that a = 1/4 and a + c = 1/2. We can solve these two equations to find c. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives c = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4 work per hour.
Step 7: Substituting a = 1/4 and c = 1/4 into the equation for the combined rates gives b = 5/6 - 1/4 - 1/4 = 1/3 work per hour.

Step 4: A and C together can complete the work in 2 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/2 work per hour.
Step 5: We can set up the following equation from the information given in the problem: a + b + c = 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6.
Step 6: We know that a = 1/4, so we can substitute this into the equation to get 1/4 + b + c = 5/6.
Step 7: We also know that b + c = 1/3, so we can substitute this into the equation to get 1/4 + 1/3 = 5/6.

Step 3: Similarly, B and C together can complete the work in 3 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/3 work per hour.
Step 4: A and C together can complete the work in 2 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/2 work per hour.
Step 5: We can write the equation for the combined rates of A, B, and C as follows: a + b + c = 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 work per hour.
Step 6: We can substitute the rate of A (a = 1/4) into this equation to find the combined rate of B and C: 1/4 + b + c = 5/6.
Step 7: Simplifying this equation gives b + c = 5/6 - 1/4 = 2/3 work per hour.
Step 8: We know from Step 2 that the combined rate of B and C is 1/3 work per hour. Therefore, we can write the equation for the rate of B as follows: b = 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3 work per hour.

Step 11: So, the next number in the sequence should be 81 - 3 = 78. However, 78 is not an option in the given choices. This means that our pattern is incorrect or the options are incorrect.

Step 2: Notice that the differences themselves form a sequence: 6, 12, 18, 23. This sequence does not seem to follow a simple pattern, so let's look at the differences between these differences.
Step 3: The difference between 12 and 6 is 6, between 18 and 12 is 6, but between 23 and 18 is 5. So, the pattern is not consistent.
Step 4: Let's try another approach. Look at the original sequence and try to find a pattern in the numbers themselves. The numbers are 5, 11, 23, 41, 64.
Step 5: Notice that 5 is 2^2 + 1, 11 is 3^2 + 2, 23 is 4^2 + 7, 41 is 5^2 + 16, and 64 is 6^2 + 28.
Step 6: The numbers added to the squares are 1, 2, 7, 16, 28. These numbers form a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous number and the next odd number starting from 1.
Step 7: So, the next number in this sequence would be 28 + 9 = 37.
Step 8: To find the next number in the original sequence, square the next number after 6, which is 7, and add 37. So, the next number is 7^2 + 37 = 49 + 37 = 86.

Step 4: Let's try another approach. Look at the original sequence and try to find a pattern in the numbers themselves. The numbers are: 5, 11, 23, 41, 64.
Step 5: If we look closely, we can see that each number can be represented as a square number plus a certain number. For example, 5 is 4 (2^2) plus 1, 11 is 9 (3^2) plus 2, 23 is 16 (4^2) plus 7, 41 is 25 (5^2) plus 16, and 64 is 36 (6^2) plus 28.
Step 6: Now, let's look at the numbers we are adding to the square numbers: 1, 2, 7, 16, 28. These numbers form a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous number and the next odd number. For example, 2 is 1 plus 1, 7 is 2 plus 5, 16 is 7 plus 9, and 28 is 16 plus 12.
Step 7: The next odd number after 12 is 15. So, the next number in this sequence should be 28 plus 15, which is 43.
Step 8: The next square number after 36 (6^2) is 49 (7^2). So, the next number in the original sequence should be 49 plus 43, which is 92.
However, 92 is not one of the options. This means that there might be a mistake in our pattern or the options are incorrect. Let's double-check our work.
Upon rechecking, it seems that there was a mistake in calculating the differences between the square numbers and the numbers in the sequence. The correct differences are 1, 2, 7, 16, 28, which are the triangular numbers (the sum of the numbers from 1 to n). So, the next difference should be the next triangular number after 28, which is 36 (the sum of the numbers from 1 to 8).
So, the next number in the sequence should be 49 (7^2) plus 36, which is 85. But again, this is not one of the options.
This suggests that the sequence might not follow a simple mathematical pattern, or there might be a mistake in the question or the options.

Step 2: From clue 4, we know that one of the numbers 9, 2, 6 is correct but not in its correct position. Since 9 can't be in the first position (from step 1), it must be in the second or third position. But from clue 1, we know that if 9 is the correct number, it must be in the third position.

Step 2: Find the length of the other diagonal. We know that one diagonal is 16 cm. Since a rhombus is a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This means that we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other diagonal. The Pythagorean theorem is a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the other two sides. In this case, a and b are both half the length of a side of the rhombus, so a = b = 17 / 2 = 8.5 cm. Plugging these values into the Pythagorean theorem gives us (8.5)^2 + (8.5)^2 = c^2, which simplifies to 72.25 = c^2. Taking the square root of both sides gives us c = sqrt(72.25) = 8.5 cm. Therefore, the other diagonal is 2c = 2 * 8.5 = 17 cm.

To find the length of the other diagonal, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the length of one side of the rhombus is the hypotenuse, and half the length of one diagonal is one of the other sides. So, (17 cm)^2 = (16 cm / 2)^2 + d2^2.

This means that we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other diagonal. The Pythagorean theorem is a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the other two sides.

The Pythagorean theorem states that a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where c is the hypotenuse of a right triangle and a and b are the other two sides. In this case, the side of the rhombus is the hypotenuse, and half of each diagonal forms the other two sides. So, we have (17^2) - (16/2)^2 = d2^2.

Step 3: Add 237 to both sides of the equation: 4W = 1200.
Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for W: W = 300.

We know that Mr. Kramer received 25 percent of all votes, which amounted to 942,568 votes. Therefore, we can set up the equation 0.25 * Total_votes = 942,568 to find the total number of votes. \n\nAfter finding the total number of votes, we can calculate the number of votes Mr. Kramer would need to win the election. Since he needs at least 50 percent of all votes to win, we can multiply the total number of votes by 0.5 to find this number.\n\nNext, we subtract the number of votes Mr. Kramer originally received from the number of votes he needs to win. This will give us the additional number of votes he needs.\n\nFinally, we divide the additional number of votes by the number of remaining votes (which is the total number of votes minus the votes Mr. Kramer originally received) and multiply by 100 to find the percentage of the remaining votes Mr. Kramer would need to win.\n\nLet\'s calculate this step by step.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of votes.\n0.25 * Total_votes = 942,568\n=> Total_votes = 942,568 / 0.25\n=> Total_votes = 3,770,272\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of votes needed to win.\nVotes_needed_to_win = 0.5 * Total_votes\n=> Votes_needed_to_win = 0.5 * 3,770,272\n=> Votes_needed_to_win = 1,885,136\n\nStep 3: Calculate the additional votes needed.\nAdditional_votes_needed = Votes_needed_to_win - votes_received\n=> Additional_votes_needed = 1,885,136 - 942,568\n=> Additional_votes_needed = 942,568\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of remaining votes.\nRemaining_votes = Total_votes - votes_received\n=> Remaining_votes = 3,770,272 - 942,568\n=> Remaining_votes = 2,827,704\n\nStep 5: Calculate the percentage of the remaining votes needed to win.\nPercentage_needed = (Additional_votes_needed / Remaining_votes) * 100\n=> Percentage_needed = (942,568 / 2,827,704) * 100\n=> Percentage_needed = 33.33%\n\nSo, Mr. Kramer would need approximately 33% of the remaining votes to win the election.

The options are: a ) no loss , b ) 10,000 , c ) 28,000 , d ) 9,500 , e ) 14,000",e,"Step 1: Denote the constant of proportionality by k. So, the price P of a stone of weight w can be written as P = k * w^2.
Step 2: A stone weighing 28 gm costs 28,000. So, we can write 28,000 = k * 28^2. Solving this equation for k, we get k = 28,000 / 28^2 = 1,000 / 28.
Step 3: The stone breaks into two pieces whose weights are in the ratio 15:13. This means that the weights of the two pieces are 15x and 13x, where x is a constant. Since the total weight of the stone is 28 gm, we can write 15x + 13x = 28, which gives x = 28 / 28 = 1. So, the weights of the two pieces are 15 gm and 13 gm.
Step 4: The price of the first piece is P1 = k * 15^2 = 1,000 / 28 * 15^2 = 15,000 / 28 * 15 = 7,500. The price of the second piece is P2 = k * 13^2 = 1,000 / 28 * 13^2 = 13,000 / 28 * 13 = 6,500.
Step 5: The total price of the two pieces is P1 + P2 = 7,500 + 6,500 = 14,000. The original price of the stone was 28,000. So, the loss incurred is 28,000 - 14,000 = 14,000.",e,"[(2, 0)]","Step 1: Denote the constant of proportionality as 'k'. So, the price of the stone can be represented as P = k * (W^2), where P is the price and W is the weight.
Step 2: Given that the stone weighs 28 gm and costs 28,000, we can substitute these values into the equation to find the value of 'k'. So, 28000 = k * (28^2). Solving this equation gives us k = 28000 / (28^2) = 35.71 (approximately).
Step 3: Now, the stone breaks into two pieces whose weights are in the ratio 15:13. This means the weights of the two pieces are 15x and 13x respectively. Since the total weight of the stone is 28 gm, we can write 15x + 13x = 28. Solving this equation gives us x = 1 gm.
Step 4: Therefore, the weights of the two pieces are 15 gm and 13 gm respectively. We can now calculate the price of each piece using the formula P = k * (W^2).
Step 5: The price of the first piece is P1 = 35.71 * (15^2) = 8032.75 and the price of the second piece is P2 = 35.71 * (13^2) = 6367.25.
Step 6: The total price of the two pieces is P1 + P2 = 8032.75 + 6367.25 = 14400.
Step 7: The loss incurred is the original price of the stone minus the total price of the two pieces, which is 28000 - 14400 = 13600.
