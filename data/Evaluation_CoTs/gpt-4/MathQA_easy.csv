Step 2: Calculate the total number of 3-digit numbers. This is simply the product of the number of possibilities for each digit. So, there are 9 possibilities for the first digit, and 10 possibilities for each of the other two digits. Therefore, the total number of 3-digit numbers is 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.

If A beats B by 48 meters or 12 seconds, it means that B runs 48 meters in the time that A runs 12 seconds. So, the speed of B is 48 meters / 12 seconds = 4 m/s.
Since A and B start at the same time and A finishes the race when B is 48 meters behind, it means that the time it takes A to finish the race is the same time it takes B to run 1000 - 48 = 952 meters.

Step 2: Find the rate of work for B by subtracting the rate of work for A and C together from the rate of work for B and C together. The rate of work for B is (1/3 - 1/4) = 1/12 of the work per hour.

Step 2: From the problem, we know that A can complete the work in 4 hours. Therefore, the rate of A is 1/4 work per hour.
Step 3: Similarly, B and C together can complete the work in 3 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/3 work per hour.
Step 4: A and C together can complete the work in 2 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/2 work per hour.
Step 5: We can write the equation for the combined rates of A, B, and C as follows: a + b + c = 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 work per hour.
Step 6: We know that a = 1/4 and a + c = 1/2. We can solve these two equations to find c. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives c = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4 work per hour.
Step 7: Substituting a = 1/4 and c = 1/4 into the equation for the combined rates gives b = 5/6 - 1/4 - 1/4 = 1/3 work per hour.

Step 4: A and C together can complete the work in 2 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/2 work per hour.
Step 5: We can set up the following equation from the information given in the problem: a + b + c = 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6.
Step 6: We know that a = 1/4, so we can substitute this into the equation to get 1/4 + b + c = 5/6.
Step 7: We also know that b + c = 1/3, so we can substitute this into the equation to get 1/4 + 1/3 = 5/6.

Step 2: From the problem, we know that A can complete the work in 4 hours. Therefore, the rate of A is 1/4 work per hour.
Step 3: Similarly, B and C together can complete the work in 3 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/3 work per hour.
Step 4: A and C together can complete the work in 2 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/2 work per hour.
Step 5: We can write the equation for the combined rates of A, B, and C as follows: a + b + c = 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 work per hour.
Step 6: We can substitute the rate of A (a = 1/4) into this equation to find the combined rate of B and C: 1/4 + b + c = 5/6.
Step 7: Simplifying this equation gives b + c = 5/6 - 1/4 = 2/3 work per hour.
Step 8: We know from Step 2 that the combined rate of B and C is 1/3 work per hour. Therefore, we can write the equation for the rate of B as follows: b = 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3 work per hour.

Step 2: We can find the rate of work for C by subtracting the rate of work for A from the rate of work for A and C. So, C = (A+C) - A = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.
Step 3: Now, we can find the rate of work for B by subtracting the rate of work for C from the rate of work for B and C. So, B = (B+C) - C = 1/3 - 1/4 = 1/12.
