Step 2: Calculate the total number of 3-digit numbers. This is simply the product of the number of possibilities for each digit. So, there are 9 possibilities for the first digit, and 10 possibilities for each of the other two digits. Therefore, the total number of 3-digit numbers is 9 * 10 * 10 = 900.
Step 3: Calculate the number of 3-digit numbers where all digits are odd. The odd digits are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. So, there are 5 possibilities for each digit. Therefore, the total number of 3-digit numbers where all digits are odd is 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.

If A beats B by 48 meters or 12 seconds, it means that B runs 48 meters in the time that A runs 12 seconds. So, the speed of B is 48 meters / 12 seconds = 4 m/s.
Since A and B start at the same time and A finishes the race when B is 48 meters behind, it means that the time it takes A to finish the race is the same time it takes B to run 1000 - 48 = 952 meters.

Step 2: Find the rate of work for B by subtracting the rate of work for A and C together from the rate of work for B and C together. The rate of work for B is (1/3 - 1/4) = 1/12 of the work per hour.

Step 2: From the problem, we know that A can complete the work in 4 hours. Therefore, the rate of A is 1/4 work per hour.
Step 3: Similarly, B and C together can complete the work in 3 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/3 work per hour.
Step 4: A and C together can complete the work in 2 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/2 work per hour.
Step 5: We can write the equation for the combined rates of A, B, and C as follows: a + b + c = 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 work per hour.
Step 6: We know that a = 1/4 and a + c = 1/2. We can solve these two equations to find c. Subtracting the first equation from the second gives c = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4 work per hour.
Step 7: Substituting a = 1/4 and c = 1/4 into the equation for the combined rates gives b = 5/6 - 1/4 - 1/4 = 1/3 work per hour.

Step 4: A and C together can complete the work in 2 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/2 work per hour.
Step 5: We can set up the following equation from the information given in the problem: a + b + c = 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6.
Step 6: We know that a = 1/4, so we can substitute this into the equation to get 1/4 + b + c = 5/6.
Step 7: We also know that b + c = 1/3, so we can substitute this into the equation to get 1/4 + 1/3 = 5/6.

Step 2: From the problem, we know that A can complete the work in 4 hours. Therefore, the rate of A is 1/4 work per hour.
Step 3: Similarly, B and C together can complete the work in 3 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/3 work per hour.
Step 4: A and C together can complete the work in 2 hours. Therefore, their combined rate is 1/2 work per hour.
Step 5: We can write the equation for the combined rates of A, B, and C as follows: a + b + c = 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 work per hour.
Step 6: We can substitute the rate of A (a = 1/4) into this equation to find the combined rate of B and C: 1/4 + b + c = 5/6.
Step 7: Simplifying this equation gives b + c = 5/6 - 1/4 = 2/3 work per hour.
Step 8: We know from Step 2 that the combined rate of B and C is 1/3 work per hour. Therefore, we can write the equation for the rate of B as follows: b = 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3 work per hour.

Step 2: We can find the rate of work for C by subtracting the rate of work for A from the rate of work for A and C. So, C = (A+C) - A = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.
Step 3: Now, we can find the rate of work for B by subtracting the rate of work for C from the rate of work for B and C. So, B = (B+C) - C = 1/3 - 1/4 = 1/12.

Step 9: But if we look at the differences between the actual number and the square (5 - 4 = 1, 11 - 9 = 2, 23 - 25 = -2, 41 - 49 = -8, 64 - 64 = 0), we can see that the differences are decreasing by 3 each time.
Step 10: If we continue this pattern, the next difference should be 0 - 3 = -3.
Step 11: So, the next number in the sequence should be 81 - 3 = 78. However, 78 is not an option in the given choices. This means that our pattern is incorrect or the options are incorrect.
Step 12: Look at the differences between the numbers in the sequence again: 6, 12, 18, 23.

Step 15: So, the difference between the next number in the sequence and 64 should be 23 + 4 = 27.

Step 2: Notice that the differences themselves form a sequence: 6, 12, 18, 23. This sequence does not seem to follow a simple pattern, so let's look at the differences between these differences.
Step 3: The difference between 12 and 6 is 6, between 18 and 12 is 6, but between 23 and 18 is 5. So, the pattern is not consistent.
Step 4: Let's try another approach. Look at the original sequence and try to find a pattern in the numbers themselves. The numbers are 5, 11, 23, 41, 64.
Step 5: Notice that 5 is 2^2 + 1, 11 is 3^2 + 2, 23 is 4^2 + 7, 41 is 5^2 + 16, and 64 is 6^2 + 28.
Step 6: The numbers added to the squares are 1, 2, 7, 16, 28. These numbers form a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous number and the next odd number starting from 1.
Step 7: So, the next number in this sequence would be 28 + 9 = 37.
Step 8: To find the next number in the original sequence, square the next number after 6, which is 7, and add 37. So, the next number is 7^2 + 37 = 49 + 37 = 86.
However, 86 is not in the options. It seems like there's a mistake in my calculations. Let's try another approach.

Step 4: Let's try another approach. Look at the original sequence and try to find a pattern in the numbers themselves. The numbers are: 5, 11, 23, 41, 64.
Step 5: If we look closely, we can see that each number can be represented as a square number plus a certain number. For example, 5 is 4 (2^2) plus 1, 11 is 9 (3^2) plus 2, 23 is 16 (4^2) plus 7, 41 is 25 (5^2) plus 16, and 64 is 36 (6^2) plus 28.
Step 6: Now, let's look at the numbers we are adding to the square numbers: 1, 2, 7, 16, 28. These numbers form a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous number and the next odd number. For example, 2 is 1 plus 1, 7 is 2 plus 5, 16 is 7 plus 9, and 28 is 16 plus 12.
Step 7: The next odd number after 12 is 15. So, the next number in this sequence should be 28 plus 15, which is 43.
Step 8: The next square number after 36 (6^2) is 49 (7^2). So, the next number in the original sequence should be 49 plus 43, which is 92.
However, 92 is not one of the options. This means that there might be a mistake in our pattern or the options are incorrect. Let's double-check our work.
Upon rechecking, it seems that there was a mistake in calculating the differences between the square numbers and the numbers in the sequence. The correct differences are 1, 2, 7, 16, 28, which are the triangular numbers (the sum of the numbers from 1 to n). So, the next difference should be the next triangular number after 28, which is 36 (the sum of the numbers from 1 to 8).
So, the next number in the sequence should be 49 (7^2) plus 36, which is 85. But again, this is not one of the options.
This suggests that the sequence might not follow a simple mathematical pattern, or there might be a mistake in the question or the options.

Step 3: Set up the equation and solve for x. Since the total work done by 3 pumps in 2 days is equal to the total work done by 15 pumps in 1 day, we can set up the following equation: 48 = 15x.
