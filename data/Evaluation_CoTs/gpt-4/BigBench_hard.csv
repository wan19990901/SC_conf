Step 2: Identify the potential antecedents for the pronoun. In this sentence, the potential antecedents for 'he' are 'the driver' and 'the tailor'.
Step 3: Apply the rules of grammar and context to determine which of the potential antecedents is the correct one. In English, when a pronoun follows two potential antecedents separated by a conjunction, it usually refers to the closest antecedent. In this case, 'he' is closer to 'the tailor' than to 'the driver'. Therefore, according to this rule, 'he' should refer to 'the tailor'.
Step 4: Check if the context supports this interpretation. The sentence says that 'The driver yelled at the tailor after he broke a window.' It makes sense that the driver would yell at the tailor if the tailor had just broken a window. Therefore, the context supports the interpretation that 'he' refers to 'the tailor'.

Step 4: Compare the interpretation with the provided options. Option (A) suggests that 'the driver' is the antecedent, which is not the most likely interpretation based on the sentence structure and context.

If 'he' refers to 'the mechanic', the sentence would mean that the mechanic is greeting the receptionist because the mechanic himself is standing in front of the door. This doesn't make much sense as it's not clear why the mechanic's position would cause him to greet the receptionist. If 'he' refers to 'the receptionist', the sentence would mean that the mechanic is greeting the receptionist because the receptionist is standing in front of the door.

Step 3: Determine the most likely antecedent",a,"[(0, 0)]","Step 1: Identify the potential antecedents for the pronoun. In this case, the potential antecedents are 'The mechanic' and 'the receptionist'.
Step 2: Analyze the sentence structure and context. The pronoun 'he' is used after the action of the mechanic greeting the receptionist, and it is connected to the action with the conjunction 'because'. This suggests that the action of standing in front of the door is the reason for the mechanic's greeting.
Step 3: Determine the most likely antecedent based on the context. Given the sentence structure and the use of 'because', it is most likely that 'he' refers to the person whose position (standing in front of the door) would be the reason for the mechanic's greeting. This could be either the mechanic or the receptionist.
Step 4: Evaluate the options. Option (A) suggests that the mechanic is the one standing in front of the door, while option (B) suggests that the receptionist is the one standing in front of the door. Both of these are plausible interpretations based on the sentence structure and context.

Step 4: Evaluate the options. Option (A) suggests that 'he' refers to 'The mechanic', and option (B) suggests that 'he' refers to 'the receptionist'. Option (C) suggests that it is ambiguous, meaning it is unclear whether 'he' refers to 'The mechanic' or 'the receptionist'.
Step 5: Make a final decision.

(C) Ambiguous",C,disambiguation_qa,BigBench_hard,"Step 1: Identify the potential antecedents for the pronoun 'she'. In this sentence, the potential antecedents could be 'the developer' or 'the secretary'.
Step 2: Determine which of the potential antecedents the pronoun is most likely referring to. In English, pronouns typically refer to the closest preceding noun. In this case, 'the secretary' is the closest preceding noun to 'she'.
Step 3: Consider the context of the sentence. The sentence says 'The developer met with the secretary because she made a mistake.' This suggests that the reason for the meeting was the mistake made by 'she'. Given the structure of the sentence, it is more likely that 'she' refers to 'the secretary', as it would make more sense for the developer to meet with the secretary if the secretary was the one who made the mistake.

The phrase 'because they asked' suggests that the person who asked for help is the one who the librarian helped. This would imply that 'they' refers to 'the CEO'. However, it could also be interpreted that 'the librarian' asked for something (perhaps assistance or information) in order to help the CEO, which would mean 'they' refers to 'the librarian'.

Step 3: Analyze the sentence structure. The pronoun 'she' is closer to 'the laborer' than to 'the nurse'. However, in English, the pronoun usually refers to the subject of the sentence, which in this case is 'the nurse'.
Step 4: Consider the gender of the antecedents. Both 'the nurse' and 'the laborer' could be female, so gender does not help us determine the antecedent of 'she'.

Step 3: Determine if the antecedent is clear or ambiguous.
