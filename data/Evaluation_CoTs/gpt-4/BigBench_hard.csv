Step 2: Identify the potential antecedents for the pronoun. In this sentence, the potential antecedents for 'he' are 'the driver' and 'the tailor'.
Step 3: Apply the rules of grammar and context to determine which of the potential antecedents is the correct one. In English, when a pronoun follows two potential antecedents separated by a conjunction, it usually refers to the closest antecedent. In this case, 'he' is closer to 'the tailor' than to 'the driver'. Therefore, according to this rule, 'he' should refer to 'the tailor'.
Step 4: Check if the context supports this interpretation. The sentence says that 'The driver yelled at the tailor after he broke a window.' It makes sense that the driver would yell at the tailor if the tailor had just broken a window. Therefore, the context supports the interpretation that 'he' refers to 'the tailor'.

Step 4: Compare the interpretation with the provided options. Option (A) suggests that 'the driver' is the antecedent, which is not the most likely interpretation based on the sentence structure and context.
