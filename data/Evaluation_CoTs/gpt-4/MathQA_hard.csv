Step 2: Add these rates together. This gives us 2*(rate of a + rate of b + rate of c) because each person is counted twice in the three pairs. So, 2*(rate of a + rate of b + rate of c) = 1/20 + 1/15 + 1/12.
Step 3: Solve the equation from step 2 to find the rate of a + b + c. This gives us (rate of a + rate of b + rate of c) = (1/20 + 1/15 + 1/12) / 2.
Step 4: Subtract the rate of a and c from the rate of a + b + c to find the rate of b. This gives us rate of b = (rate of a + rate of b + rate of c) - rate of c and a = (1/20 + 1/15 + 1/12) / 2 - 1/12.

Step 3: And c and a together can do the work in 12 days, so their combined rate is 1/12 of the work per day.
Step 4: If we add these three rates together, we get (1/20 + 1/15 + 1/12) = 1/10 + 1/10 + 1/10 = 3/10 of the work per day. This is twice the rate of a, b, and c together, because each person is counted twice in this sum.

Step 2: Add these rates together. This gives us the amount of work done by two a's, two b's, and two c's in one day. So, 2(a + b + c) = 1/20 + 1/15 + 1/12.
Step 3: Simplify the right side of the equation. The least common multiple of 20, 15, and 12 is 60, so we can write the right side of the equation as (3 + 4 + 5)/60 = 12/60 = 1/5.
Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to find the amount of work done by a, b, and c in one day. So, a + b + c = 1/10.
Step 5: Subtract the rates of a and c from the total rate to find the rate of b. We know that a and c together do 1/12 of the work in one day, so b = 1/10 - 1/12.
Step 6: Simplify the right side of the equation. The least common multiple of 10 and 12 is 60, so we can write the right side of the equation as (6 - 5)/60 = 1/60.
Step 7: The rate of b is the reciprocal of the number of days it takes b to complete the work alone. So, b can complete the work alone in 60 days.",b,"[(0, 0)]","Step 1: Find the combined rates of a and b, b and c, and a and c.
