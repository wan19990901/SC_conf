It seems like the code is not working. Can you help me fix it?

A: It looks like there is an error in the code that is causing the function to not return the correct answer.

One possible issue is with the line `today = datetime(2015, 1, 1) - relativedelta(hours=36)`. This line calculates the time difference between now and January 1, 2015, but it does not take into account that January 1, 2015 was a Friday, and today is a Monday.
