The sum of the heights is 50 + 60 + 80 + 70 = 250.
The total count of penguins is 4.
So the average height is 250/4 = 62.5 cm.
As per the question, the acceptable value is in cm, so we convert 62.5 cm to inches,",error,"[(0, 0)]"," A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on the height. We know the following: The heights of the penguins in the table are 50 cm, 60 cm, 80 cm, and 70 cm.
We need to find the average of these numbers.
To find the average, we add all the heights and divide by the total count of the heights.
The average height of the penguins is (50 + 60 + 80 + 70) / 4 = 60 cm.
The average height of the penguins is 60 cm. So the answer is (A).
