To find out how many penguins are less than 8 years old and weight more than 12 kg, we can use the following steps:
Step 1: Find out how many penguins are less than 8 years old: 2 (Louis and Bernard)
Step 2: Find out how many penguins weigh more than 12 kg: 2 (Louis and Bernard)
Since there is an overlap between the two sets, we can subtract the number of penguins that are both less than 8 years old and weigh more than 12 kg (overlap) from the total number of penguins that are less than 8 years old and weigh more than 12 kg to find out the number of penguins that are less than 8",,"[(0, 0)]"," A: Let's think step by step.

Bernard is not one year younger than Vincent because Bernard is already 5 years old, which is not one year younger than 9.
Gwen is not one year younger than Vincent because Gwen is already 8 years old, which is not one year younger than 9.
James is not in the table, so we cannot determine if James is one year younger than Vincent or not.
Therefore, we don't have enough information to determine which penguin is one year younger than Vincent.

This question focuses on the age. We know the following: The ages of the penguins in the table are Louis (7), Bernard (5), Vincent (9), and Gwen (8).
According to the table, Vincent is 9 years old and the question asks for a penguin that is one year younger than Vincent.
The penguins that are younger than Vincent are Louis and Bernard.
We know that Bernard is 5 years old, so he is one year younger than Vincent. Hence, the answer is (B).
Also, Louis is 7 years old, but he is not one year younger than Vincent.
So, the answer is (B).
