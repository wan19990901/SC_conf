## Using `dateutil.relativedelta` to calculate dates

`dateutil`'s `relativedelta` is a very useful tool for calculating dates. It's the Python version of an R package.

`relativedelta` is a class within the `dateutil.relativedelta` module. You can use it to easily perform date calculations. With `relativedelta`, you can add or subtract a specific number of years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, or microseconds to a `datetime` object.

For example,

```python
# To add one week to a date.
dt = datetime(2019, 1, 1)
dt_plus_one_week = dt + relativedelta(",,"[(0, 0)]","# The day before yesterday was 11/23/1933.
the_day_before_yesterday = datetime(1933, 11, 23)
# Tomorrow,
tomorrow = the_day_before_yesterday + relativedelta(days=2)
# The answer formatted with %m/%d/%Y is
tomorrow.strftime('%m/%d/%Y')
