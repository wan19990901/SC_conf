Question:

IV for Invalid answer?
DIF_SUB does not work
too slow if data gets large
Need a automatic/systematic way to select features
need different window size (as ablation study) to justify our work

TO DO:

Plots and experiments for different N


1: Fix features (by selection)
2: Run different tests on different N and optimization methods
3: Viz
4: clean data (make sure 2.0 == 2)
