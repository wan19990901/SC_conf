Question:

IV for Invalid answer?
DIF_SUB does not work
too slow if data gets large
Need a automatic/systematic way to select features
need different window size (as ablation study) to justify our work

TO DO:

Plots and experiments for different N


1: Fix features (by selection) (select on ROC or final results?); Run a BERT regression on CoT directly.

2: Run different tests on different N and optimization methods run all data, how to pick best model? (acc vs steps)

3: llama

4: Viz more.
